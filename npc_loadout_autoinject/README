Provides supplemental loadout injector for npc loadout configs.

Weapons can be added to stalkers on a faction/rank/slot basis. Currently there is no support for visual/squad overriding.

There are two importers - npc_importer and wep_importer. Both are needed in order to add weapons.

npc_importer imports a ton of sections. Sample is provided with comments.

wep_importer is a list of weapons. Sample is provided with comments.
