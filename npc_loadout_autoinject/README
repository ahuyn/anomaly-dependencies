Provides injector for npc loadout configs.

How loadouts work (READ CAREFULLY)
NPC loadouts are routed based on:
- Community (Faction)
- Rank
- Slot (Primary, Secondary, Extra)

These sink down to sections that contain a ton of weapons - e.g. [isg_primary] or [killer_veteran_primary]

What this tool allows you to do is to add weapons or define new configs for these sections.

There is no support (yet!) for changing the routing to new custom sections based on squad rank / npc visual / other stuff. Use the existing sections.

How to use:

There are two importers - npc_importer and wep_importer. Both are needed in order to add weapons.

npc_importer imports a ton of sections. Sample is provided with comments.

wep_importer is a list of weapons. Sample is provided with comments.
