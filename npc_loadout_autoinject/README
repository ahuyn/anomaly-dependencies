Provides injector for npc loadout configs.

How loadouts work (READ CAREFULLY)
NPC loadouts are routed based on various factors:

; How it works
; When an npc spawn in the Zone, a loadout will be decided and spawned on him based on many factors:
; 1. Script will check [loadouts_per_squad] first to see if NPC's squad section name has a defined loadout
; 2. if not found, then it will [loadouts_per_name] to see if NPC's section name has a defined loadout
; 3. if not found, then it will [loadouts_per_visual] to see if NPC's model has a defined loadout
; 4. if not found, then it will check NPC's rank and community loadout [loadout_"community"_"rank"]
; 5. if not found, then it will check NPC's community loadout only [loadout_"community"]
; 6. if not found, then it will check the default loadout [loadout_default]

Under these sections are keys for primary, secondary and extra that map to a weapon pool.

What this tool allows you to do is to add weapons to or entirely replace these pools.

To change the routing, it is recommended to use the vanilla system to add mappings to weapon pools.

How to use:

There are two importers - npc_importer and wep_importer. Both are needed in order to add weapons.

npc_importer imports a ton of sections. Sample is provided with comments.

wep_importer is a list of weapons. Sample is provided with comments.
